# Dotfiles

The dotfiles I use to setup, customize and maintain my macOS installation. Includes installation scripts, bash profile, some configuration files and a few useful tools.

Almost all software I use is managed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) in combination with [Cask](https://caskroom.github.io) and [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle), Gem or NPM.
