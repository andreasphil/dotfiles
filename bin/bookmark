# BOOKMARKS
#
# Simple hack for an easy to manage bookmark list. Bookmarks need to be placed
# as softlinks in the folder configured in `bookmark_dir`. When called, the
# command displays a list with all bookmarks that can be fuzzy-filtered. The
# selected link will be opened when confirmed. Note that this requires you to
# run the command in the existing shell using the `source` command.
#
# Requires fzf to be installed: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
# If Homebrew is available, it can be installed via: `brew install fzf`
#
# Usage: bookmarks
#   - this (create a bookmark for the current folder)
#   - create <location> [<name>] (create a bookmark with <name> for <location>)
#   - delete <name> (delete <name>)
#   - list (show all bookmarks)
#   - help (display this help)
